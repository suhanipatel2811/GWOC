    <h1 class="section-title">What Makes Us Different</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
      At MindSettler, we believe mental well-being is not one-size-fits-all.
      Our approach is thoughtful, personalized, and built around real human needs.
    </p>

    <!-- Point 1 -->
    <div class="difference-card">
      <h2>Personalized & Human-Centered Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Every individual is unique, and so are their challenges. We focus on
        understanding your personal journey and tailoring support that truly
        fits your emotional, mental, and psychological needs.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Point 2 -->
    <div class="difference-card">
      <h2>Focus on Awareness Before Action</h2>
      <p>
        We strongly believe that healing begins with understanding.
        Our psycho-education resources help users become aware of their
        mental health before moving toward solutions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Point 3 -->
    <div class="difference-card">
      <h2>Simple, Transparent & Accessible</h2>
      <p>
        No complicated processes or overwhelming steps.
        From browsing resources to booking sessions, everything is designed
        to be smooth, clear, and accessible for everyone.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Point 4 -->
    <div class="difference-card">
      <h2>Technology with Empathy</h2>
      <p>
        While we use technology to make support accessible, our core remains human.
        Chatbots, forms, and systems are designed to assist — not replace —
        real emotional understanding.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Point 5 -->
    <div class="difference-card">
      <h2>Support Beyond Sessions</h2>
      <p>
        MindSettler doesn’t stop at appointments.
        We provide continuous learning through blogs, videos, and guidance,
        helping users grow even outside scheduled sessions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Point 6 -->
    <div class="difference-card">
      <h2>Corporate & Community Well-being</h2>
      <p>
        Along with individual support, we work with organizations to build
        emotionally healthy workplaces through workshops, training,
        and customized well-being programs.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="closing-text">
      MindSettler is not just a service — it is a safe space where understanding,
      growth, and mental well-being come together.
