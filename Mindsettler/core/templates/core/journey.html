    <h1 class>Our Journey</h1>
    <p class>
      MindSettler was born from a simple belief — mental well-being should be
      understood, accessible, and compassionate. Our journey is built on
      listening, learning, and supporting minds at every step.
    </p>

        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p>
          MindSettler began with a vision to break the silence around mental health.
          We noticed the lack of awareness, stigma, and safe spaces for people
          to express what they truly feel.

      <div class="step-content">
        <h2>Understanding the Need</h2>
        <p>
          Through research, conversations, and real-life experiences,
          we understood that people don’t just need solutions —
          they need understanding, education, and empathy.

        <h2>Building Awareness</h2>
        <p>
          Psycho-education became our foundation.
          We focused on creating content and resources that help individuals
          understand their emotions, thoughts, and mental health.

          when users felt ready to take the next step.
